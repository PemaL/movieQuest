We created an app called Movie Query based off version 3 of The Movie Data Base’s API.

We used a movie search API where we created a form where users can search and get the results of their submitted response using DOM maniputlation to create and append the searched movie title with a poster image.

We then used our knowledge of event listeners to render out a modal box when the user clicks on a movie where it’ll display the movie title, along with a description, rating, and release date of the movie.

We also used The Movie DB’s popular and upcoming movie API’s. Using the slice method we rendered out the first 5 movies for each section for simplicity and a clean look. 

Lastly using CSS, we styled along the way of each section. We used many properties but we had most fun with the animation,
